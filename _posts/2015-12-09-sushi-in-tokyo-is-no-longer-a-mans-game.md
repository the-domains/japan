description: "Behind the counter at Nadeshico Sushi, young women dressed in traditional Japanese happi coats, rolled, cut and served sushi while smiling and chatting with their customers. Their cheerful nature brightened up the room, and the diners - the majority of whom were either young Japanese guys or curious foreigners - couldn't help but be charmed."
