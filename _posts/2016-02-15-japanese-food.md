# Japanese food!

These are some pictures from our dinner in Sakawa with Sean and Kelly.  

This soup is called Tan Tan men. Its a spicy noodle dish that was  quite good! The Second picture is big shrimp! 大エビ！It was also very good. Johanna discovered that she actually does like eating the shrimp heads and tails. I like them too sometimes. Never thought I'd say that!
