# Sports Day
![](https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/11214089_10206751582811045_1075366803617020827_n.jpg?oh=101374a0b4f27ded6764a10d153c575d&oe=571B6FBF)

Sports Day is definitely one of the more interesting events in the Japanese School year. I've been to three of them. All have their own unique flare, and the students love to compete with one another for the coveted top prize.

Each school is divided into several teams (from three up to six) and each team is given a separate color. I am on the blue team in the picture above. The day is comprised of a series of events. There are lots of relays; the standard boys and girls relays as well as fun relays where the students have to race while dribbling a basketball or wearing their club uniforms. 

Another entails popping a ballon by sitting on it and then fishing for a candy in a plate of flour. 

Sports day is particularly significant for third year students. They are the sempai's of the school and this is their last chance to lead  their team to victory.
